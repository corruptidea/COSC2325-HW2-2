# COSC2325-HW2-2

Use a loop with indirect or indexed addressing to reverse the elements of an integer array in place.
Do not copy the elements to any other array. Use the SIZEOF, TYPE, and LENGTHOF
operators to make the program as flexible as possible if the array size and type should be changed
in the future.
